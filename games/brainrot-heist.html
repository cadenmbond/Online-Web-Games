        <p id="game-description">Your main aim in this steal-a-brainrot game is to collect as many Italian characters as you can to generate income for yourself. The characters you place your base will earn you idle money every second. The rarest characters earn you the most significant amount of in-game currency. However, you can start collecting common characters, such as Bombardiro, at the beginning. Then, you can head for the rarest ones! Or, you may raid the characters from other players’ bases.</p>
